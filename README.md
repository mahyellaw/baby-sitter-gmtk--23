## Project Summary. 📝

"Baby Sitter" is my 48-hour jam entry for this year's GMTK Game Jam with the theme: _**Roles Reversed.**_ <br>
Our take on the theme is simply a game about a baby taking care of its parent, rather than the other way around. <br>
The concept was mainly brainstormed by me and the boiz, especially my big brain boi [@Mizu](https://www.youtube.com/@mizuki.69).
